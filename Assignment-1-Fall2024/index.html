     which he suffered from as the lyrics also imply. Now my challenge was to try finding a font and styling that fits. -->
    <!-- Song Lyrics -->
    <p>We chase misprinted lies
        We face the path of time
        And yet I fight, and yet I fight
        This battle all alone
        No one to cry to
        No place to call home
        Ooh
        Ooh-ooh
        Ooh
        Ooh-ooh
        My gift of self is raped
        My privacy is raked
        And yet I find, and yet I find
        Repeating in my head
        If I can't be my own
        I'd feel better dead
        Ooh
        Ooh-ooh
        Ooh
        Ooh-ooh...
    </p>
